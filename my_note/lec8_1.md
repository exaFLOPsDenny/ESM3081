## Unsupervised Learning
> (in general) Unlabeled training dataset  
> Goal is to find useful properties/patterns of the structures of the dataset

#### Unsupervised Learning is relatively harder than Supervised Learning with respect to understanding and evaluating. It is subjective in the sense of PATTERN they think to use as a standard.

- A major challenge in unsupervised learning is evaluating whether the algorithm 
learned something useful.  
    - Rather than tuning the hyperparameters, manually evaluation is needed.

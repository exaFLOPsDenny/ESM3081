## Types of Learning  
- Model-Based Learning (Eager Learning)  
> Training phase: Build a model using training data  
> Prediction phase: Use the model to make predictions  
- Instance-Based Learning (Lazy Learning)  
> Training phase: Do nothing  
> Prediction phase: Compare new instances with training data to make predictions

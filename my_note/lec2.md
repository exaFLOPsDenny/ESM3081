## Types of Learning  
- Model-Based Learning (Eager Learning)  
> Training phase: Build a model using training data  
> Prediction phase: Use the model to make predictions  

- Instance-Based Learning (Lazy Learning)  
> Training phase: Do nothing  
> Prediction phase: Compare new instances with training data to make predictions  
> When to use : As it takes less time in training but more on predicting, good for situations when data becomes available gradually over time.   

## k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

> 1. Compute distance from new instance point x to each data point in **D (distance metric))**
> 2.

# learning

ㅁ Generalizing training dataset to build a prediction model for unknown test data  
ㅁ Prediction model is a functional relationship between X and y  

# Supervised
 
ㅁ Training dataset with labels  
ㅁ Type   
        1) Classification (class label- discrete)  
        2) Regression (continuity label)  
    
# Generalization

ㅁ Accurate for unknown data  
ㅁ Type of failure  
- Overfitting  
    2) Underfitting  

ㅁ Relevance between generalization failure and model complexity  
    Larger variety of data points(more data you collect) more complex model you can use without overfitting  

    Tradeoff between accuracy and model complexity

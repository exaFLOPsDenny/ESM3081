## Learning

> Generalizing training dataset to build a prediction model for unknown test data  
> Prediction model is a functional relationship between X and y  

## Supervised
 
> Training dataset with labels  
ㅁ Type   
- Classification (class label- discrete)  
- Regression (continuity label)  
    
## Generalization

> Accurate for unknown data  
ㅁ Type of failure  
- Overfitting  
- Underfitting  


> Relevance between generalization failure and model complexity  
- Larger variety of data points(more data you collect) more complex model you can use without overfitting  
- Tradeoff between accuracy and model complexity

## Dataset

Training set  
> to learn the parameters of the model

Validation set  
> to choose the hyperparameters of the model  

Test set  
> for final evaluation of the generalizaiton ability of the model

## Unsupervised Learning: Clustering

### Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)

- Desity-Based Clustering
    - Cluster is a dense region of data points, which is separated by low-density regions, from other high-density regions
- DBSCAN
    - DBSCAN works by identifying points that are in "crowded"(dense) regions of the feature space, where many data points are close together
    - DBSCAN has no predict method

- Strengths
    - No assumption on # of clusters
    - Complex shape of clusters
    - Avable on identifying noise, robust to outliers
- Weeknesses
    - Hard on large differences in densities
    - Week on high dim dataset
    - Highly depends on feature scaling
    
#### Terminology
All data points can be assigned into core/ border/ noise points.  
- core point: if the number of points within the distance eps is greater than or equal to min_samples
- border point: not a core point but in the neighborhood of a core point
- noise point: neither core point nor border point

#### Hyperparameters
- Distance metric(feature scaling & one-hot encoding)
- eps(ilon)
    - Maximum radius of the neighborhood
    - Setting is often easier after feature scaling
    - eps implicity control how many clusters will be found
    - Big eps ~ cluster grow ~ multiple cluster join into one
- min_samples
    - Minimum number of points in an eps-neighborhood
    - Big min_samples ~ fewer core points ~ more noise

**Goal: Desity-Based Clustering free from noise**
1. Label all points as core, border, or noise points
2. Put an edge between all core points within a distance eps of each other
3. Make each group of connected core points into a separate cluster.
4. Assign each border point to one of the clusters of its associated core points.

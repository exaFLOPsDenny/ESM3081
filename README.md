Purpose: To take notes and leave records of project

Things to keep in mind 
- **Setting the right hyperparameters** is important for good performance.
- Some of the algorithms are also sensitive to how we **represent the input data**.
- Blindly applying an algorithm to a dataset without **understanding the assumptions the algorithm makes and the meanings of the hyperparameter settings** will rarely lead to an accurate model.
- One can usually do much better with a **correct application of a commonplace algorithm** than by sloppily applying an obscure algorithm


A model is a **simplified version** of the observations (training data).
-The simplifications are meant to discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to 
generalize to new data.
-However, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make 
assumptions.
-For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear 
and that the distance between the data points and the straight line is just noise, which 
can safely be ignored
